Firkant
========
Firkant is an Ampache client. It's got a nice clean UI that gets out of the way and let's your music shine. Firkant is the first Ampache client with real caching, letting you select parts of your Ampache library to keep a local copy of. This makes it possible to play your cached library whitout an internet connection!
