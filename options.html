<h3>Tecnical Details:</h3>
When a song is cached it's marked instantaniously, but that doesn't mean that it's downloaded yet. The browser will begin to
download the songs at once, saving them in the application cache using the html5 file-API.
If you shut down the app while it's downloading songs, it will continue where it left when you turn it back on (given that you have a internet connection.)
Currently there is no way of seeing which tracks are already downloaded. This could lead to funky behaviour if you set a lot of
tracks for caching. Shut down the app before it's done downloading. If you don't have an internet connection when you turn the app back on,
it will still show the tracks that you have marked for caching but not downloaded yet. Trying to play them will fail, but should not crash the application.
